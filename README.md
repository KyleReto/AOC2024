# Advent of Code 2024

This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](<https://adventofcode.com/2024>), written in Python 3.

## What is Advent of Code?

* [Advent of Code](<https://adventofcode.com/>), or AoC for short, is an annual set of 25 programming challenges, where one challenge is published every day of December until the 25th.
The challenges vary in difficulty, but they generally start easy and **get more difficult over the course of the month**, with difficulty spikes on weekends.  
* Unlike most programming challenges, **each problem comes in two parts**, with the second being hidden until you complete the first. The second part usually takes the same problem and tweaks the requirements of the solution to be more complex. This rewards efficient and clean solutions more than quick and concise ones.  
* People complete the challenges with different goals in mind, but this year **I'm aiming to write clean, maintainable code** in Python for each problem. You can see my solution to each day in the `days/day_*.py` files, where `*` is the number of the day, e.g. [`days/day_1.py`](days/day_1.py).
* Some people aim to complete the challenges quickly, to make the speed leaderboard. I don't plan to compete on this metric, but in case it comes up, **I'll always wait until the
leaderboard for the day is full before I publish my code**, [as required by AoC](<https://adventofcode.com/2024/about#faq_streaming>). Feel free to copy this code to study my (mediocre) solutions to these problems, but don't expect make the leaderboard by doing so.

## How do I run the code?

1. Ensure you have a recent version of Python 3 installed (I use [Python 3.11.5](<https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3115/>))
2. Run `python3 main.py` to run the latest day. You can use the `-h` option for more detailed usage instructions.  
   * I use Bash in Linux (with [WSL](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>)). While the code should run fine in other environments, I can't guarantee that.
3. You don't *need* to do anything else, but this list is really short and it makes me uncomfortable, so here's some totally unrelated things you should do:
   * Make some crème brûlée, I like [this recipe](<https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/classic-creme-brulee-recipe>).
   * Get some friends together and play a board game. My favorite is [Codenames](<https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames>).
   * Try a new video game. [Hacknet](<https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet/>) super underrated, give it a try.
